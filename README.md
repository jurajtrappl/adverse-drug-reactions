# adverse-drug-reactions
Classification machine learning models for SIDER dataset of SMILES and their adverse drug reactions.

# To do:
-  Look at the WEs of enatiomers
-  Graph Embedding
-  Tautomerization
-  SMOTE on WE vectors
- Dataset capturing the dynamics of ADRs
- Look for related work / patent
